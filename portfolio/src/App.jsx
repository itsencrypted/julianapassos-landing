Juliana is a trusted partner to investors and entrepreneurs navigating the digital asset ecosystem & technology stocks. She has invested in over 120 companies in the digital asset ecosystem, first as a solo entrepreneur, where she was a key member in many hackathon founding teams. She is an active angel investor, and in the process of building her first investment firm. </p>
<p> Before she was involved in the tech & digital asset ecosystem, Juliana worked as a derivatives trader in Wall Street (mostly with very volatile Brazilian interest rate futures & swaps and commodities). She worked as an Investment advisor at UBS Bank for the Wealth Management clientele. When she isnâ€™t talking about investment opportunities, and the economic scenario, she can be found reading about neuroscience & development psychology, semiconductors, engaging in outdoor sports (cycling, skiing, running) or exploring new cities in Europe with her friends.</p>
